Cell classification


This study presents a novel approach for cell state classification in imaging flow cytometry data. Machine learning algorithms and feature extraction techniques have been used to extract meaningful information from multidimensional imaging data. Our approach utilizes spatial and morphological features captured by imaging flow cytometry for accurate discrimination of different cell states and types. By employing UMAP for dimension reduction, data were pre-processed. A clustering DBSCAN algorithm allows the labelling of each cell. Various machine learning algorithms, including support random forests, and MLP models, are used for cell classification based on the previous labelled data. Evaluation using synthetic and real imaging flow cytometry datasets demonstrates the effectiveness in accurately classifying cell states and types.
